# Tourist Team

This is an app developed for the course mobserv at EURECOM.

The idea is that tourists that are visiting a city can team up with those in a similar situation and visit places together.

The main screen presents three tabs: A list/map of the city you are visiting, your teams and your personal settings.

For now, profile and activity data is provided through local .csv files
For the team data, a Java servlet was set up (source code included). The servlet runs on Google app engine on the following address: http://tourist-team.appspot.com
